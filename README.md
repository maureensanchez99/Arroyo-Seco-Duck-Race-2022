# Arroyo Seco Duck Race 2022  

This code is used to power our duck created for the Arroyo Seco Duck Race 2022.  
## Purpose    
Students will follow the engineering design cycle to design, construct, prototype, test, and compete enhanced large floating ducks to go the fastest up and down a stretch of river at the Arroyo Seco Unlimited Engineering Duck Race remote control of the ducks.  
## Challenge  
With a budget of $200 and a timeframe of 5 weeks, our team had to design, code, and build around a 12 in rubber duck inflatable so that we can remotely operate it in the Arroyo Seco Unlimitied Engineering Duck Race.
